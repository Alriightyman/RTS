# Programming an RTS Game With Direct3D

## Description
This is the source that was once included with a book called, "Programming an RTS Game With Direct3D".  The original source targeted Direct3D 8 but later was updated to Direct3D 9. This project was originally meant to convert the projects to use Direct3D 11.  However, considereing that there are now better options for games these days, I see no reason to continue working on this.
